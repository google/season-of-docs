Goodness Chris-Ugari | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/goodness-chris-ugari/), [Résumé](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jb8sZmIfmKvrXpy66kJzCDipIEYVYRSNsiOlI61Xz3o/edit?usp=sharing) | As an experienced technical writer, I enjoy curating high-quality, easy-to-understand and accessible documentation, articles, user-guides and tutorials. I have experience working with JavaScript, Python, DevOps/Cloud technologies, Linux, Git, Markdown, and reStructuredText. I have excellent communication skills, both written and verbal, which enable me to articulate complex technical ideas to those without a technical background.
