Yash Pal | Hey I wanted to apply to Google Season of Docs and seeing a lot of participants and their resume I asked myself what should I showcase from my experience in the time I've been learning to code. So I thought why should'nt I let my work speaks for itself and I upto my level of knowledge I published technical blogs on Hashnode[https://afk-yash.hashnode.dev/] | My interests and passion lies in Java, Computer Networking(HTTP, OSI/TCP), DataBase Management and Systems and a zeal to learn and explore different domains of Computer Science like Machine Learning, WebDev and many more. I also share my learnings on twitter. | Hashnode[https://afk-yash.hashnode.dev/], Twitter[https://twitter.com/yashtwtss], Linkedin[https://www.linkedin.com/in/yash-pal-88621224b/], github[https://github.com/yashpal2104].
