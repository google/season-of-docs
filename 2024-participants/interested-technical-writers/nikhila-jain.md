Nikhila Jain | [Portfolio](https://www.nikhilajain.com) | As a Technical Writer, I specialize in Developer-focused documentation, Docs-as-Code methodologies, API documentation, and implementing the Diataxis framework for structured documentation. I'm skilled in creating engaging tutorials and how-to guides, contributing to open-source projects, and enhancing documentation workflows with Docs-as-Code practices using GitHub. My proficiency with static site generators like Docusaurus and GitBook, coupled with a strong background in programming languages (Java, JavaScript, AWS, React, Node), empowers me to craft technically accurate and developer-friendly documentation. Passionate about bridging the development and documentation divide through innovative tools and practices, I bring over a decade of experience in software development to my work. In the last 8 years, leading cross-functional teams—including developers, testers, business analysts, and technical writers—has been a profound learning journey, further honing my leadership skills. I am a firm believer in Agile methodologies, which I've successfully implemented to streamline and expedite documentation processes.
