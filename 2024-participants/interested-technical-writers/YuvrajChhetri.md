I’ve been contributing to Open Source via Jenkins, Kubernetes, JenkinsX, SamagraX for around 1-2 years. During this time I learnt a lot of things ranging from Technical Knowledge about writing good and readable code, and understanding code written by someone else to how to interact with people, and how to respond to reviews and feedback. I learnt the value of Empathy because Opensource runs on Empathy, Communication and Code Obviously ;). Having the qualities of curiosity, hard work, and persistence can greatly enhance a person's value. As for myself, I possess these three qualities and have demonstrated them effectively while working on issues and pull requests. With these qualities, I am confident that I can complete any task successfully.
