Shubhendra Singh Chauhan | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/withshubh/), [Dev.to](https://dev.to/camelcaseguy), [Portfolio](http://camelcaseguy.com) | I have over three years of experience as a Developer Advocate, focusing on creating developer education content and product and API documentation. My work involves making complex technical concepts easy to understand for developers, using tutorials, guides, and documentation that speak directly to their needs. I use Docs-as-Code practices to keep documentation up-to-date alongside software development, ensuring materials are both accessible and practical for developer workflows.
