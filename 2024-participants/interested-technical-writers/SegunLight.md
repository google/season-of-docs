I have worked on SeasonOfDocs open-source projects such as Fastify and Ushahidi during this period. I have experience creating API documentation, user guides, and other product documentation. Recently, I had the opportunity to work with [Chris Chinchilla](https://github.com/ChrisChinchilla), the author of the book "[Technical Writing for Software Developers](https://www.packtpub.com/product/technical-writing-for-software-developers/9781835080405)," as a reviewer for Packt.
