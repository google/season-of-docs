So I thought why shouldn't I let my work speaks for itself and I upto my level of knowledge I published technical blogs on Hashnode. My interests and passion lies in Java, Computer Networking(HTTP, OSI/TCP), DataBase Management and Systems and a zeal to learn and explore different domains of Computer Science like Machine Learning, WebDev and many more. I also share my learnings on twitter.
