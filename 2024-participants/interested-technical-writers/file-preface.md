    If you have more than one link, use this format:

1. [Create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to add your file to the [interested-technical-writers](./interested-technical-writers) directory.

_NOTE: To add your information to this repo you will need to sign the Google CLA. For more information on the CLA, see [the Google CLA page](https://cla.developers.google.com/about)._

**If your Markdown file is not valid, it will not be included in the directory.**

### Project Admins

Use this directory to find technical writers who may be a good fit for your project. Please note that inclusion in this list does not mean that these technical writers have been vetted or recommended by the Google Season of Docs program; it is only a convenience to allow project admins to find technical writers interested in participating. Please review the information provided by the technical writers carefully before making your hiring decision. See the [Google Season of Docs admin guide](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/tech-writer-selection) for technical writer hiring tips.
