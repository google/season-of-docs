### Technical writers interested in being contacted by projects or organizations
  If you are a technical writer interested in working with an open source project, add a Markdown file with your information, including a link to your portfolio, personal site, résumé, or CV and an indication of your interests to the [`interested-technical-writers`](./interested-technical-writers/README.md) folder. Make sure your personal information link includes contact information. **Do not add your email address to this repo.** 

Use this format for your Markdown file.

Save your Markdown file as YOURNAME.md. We will concatenate the files into a table and display it on the [interested technical writers page](./interested-technical-writers/interested-technical-writers.md), beginning Monday, February 19.

**If your Markdown file is not valid, it will not be displayed.**
