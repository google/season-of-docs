# Best Practices from the Season of Docs Program

## Budget
* Account for variation in local pay scales when budgeting for your technical writer [Compiler Research](https://compiler-research.org/assets/docs/gsod_casestudy_2023.pdf)
* Budget based on an hourly rate for an experienced, but not senior, technical writer [Conda](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-dot-org/discussions/168)
* Research a good target payment rate for Tech Writers (e.g. [WriteTheDocs Salary Survey](https://www.writethedocs.org/surveys/index.html), [US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes273042.htm))  [Sigstore](https://github.com/sigstore/docs/wiki/Sigstore-Google-Season-of-Docs-2023-Case-Study)

## Communication
* Give regular doc updates at any maintainers' or project leadership meetings [Matplotlib](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UxuvoPUh9CPyxyc_bxJ398di-WJJNB7mJQMVrhPD6_E/edit)
* Determine a regular meeting cadence with your tech writer. [Compiler Research](https://compiler-research.org/assets/docs/gsod_casestudy_2023.pdf) [p5js](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CUdWiUtPJ66seFq_X_nwFUcUnow2eH8Sl2am_HFnm0E/edit)
* Use Slack (or similar) for regular communication [Compiler Research](https://compiler-research.org/assets/docs/gsod_casestudy_2023.pdf)
* Consider different review channels for the project (e.g. GitHub, Google Docs, Notion, etc.) [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/wiki/Google-Season-of-Docs-2023:-NumPy-case-study)

## Mentorship
* Identify internal technical resources who can partner with the Tech Writer on their project [OpenQuake](https://docs.google.com/document/d/191xaDUmcoR2sx8VuYVB1mVwrFuD0br685cK0sdmPrb4/edit#heading=h.p1qoh7shayvf)
    
## Onboarding
* Creating a friction log is a great way for the new tech writer to get familiar with the project [Sigstore](https://github.com/sigstore/docs/wiki/Sigstore-Google-Season-of-Docs-2023-Case-Study)
* If possible, don’t require the Tech Writer to replicate the developer experience if it’s not necessary. Provide technical support to let them focus on documentation tasks [Matplotlib](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UxuvoPUh9CPyxyc_bxJ398di-WJJNB7mJQMVrhPD6_E/edit)
* Budget plenty of time for onboarding, taking into account the complexity of the project [Matplotlib](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UxuvoPUh9CPyxyc_bxJ398di-WJJNB7mJQMVrhPD6_E/edit)
* If your project uses 'good-first-issue' tags, use those issues to help onboard new TW contributors. [AsyncAPI](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/961)

## Participants
* It may be helpful to recruit community testers to test the documentation [p5js](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CUdWiUtPJ66seFq_X_nwFUcUnow2eH8Sl2am_HFnm0E/edit) [Digital Biomarker Discovery Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eJb7kUmn7jBnDrXE6rz2Egt_mhO8tqj0MQbrti9mofU/edit)
* Reach out to community members for help with testing accessibility [Sigstore](https://github.com/sigstore/docs/wiki/Sigstore-Google-Season-of-Docs-2023-Case-Study)

## Project Deliverables
* Sometimes it’s better to focus on creating sustainable infrastructure or processes for documentation rather than the documentation itself [Matplotlib](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UxuvoPUh9CPyxyc_bxJ398di-WJJNB7mJQMVrhPD6_E/edit)
* If you’re developing a new process, it might be valuable to test things out with an in-person sprint (with snacks!) [Matplotlib](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UxuvoPUh9CPyxyc_bxJ398di-WJJNB7mJQMVrhPD6_E/edit)

## Project Scoping & Project Management
* Leave time for testing and feedback [OpenQuake](https://docs.google.com/document/d/191xaDUmcoR2sx8VuYVB1mVwrFuD0br685cK0sdmPrb4/edit#heading=h.p1qoh7shayvf)
* If possible, perform a docs audit either before the application stage or as an early deliverable of the project, especially if you have large amounts of or complicated documentation already. [Conda](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-dot-org/discussions/168)
* Be realistic about achievable goals [Matplotlib](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UxuvoPUh9CPyxyc_bxJ398di-WJJNB7mJQMVrhPD6_E/edit)
* Be open to the Tech Writer’s role shifting depending on the project and their particular background and skills [Digital Biomarker Discovery Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eJb7kUmn7jBnDrXE6rz2Egt_mhO8tqj0MQbrti9mofU/edit) [Sigstore](https://github.com/sigstore/docs/wiki/Sigstore-Google-Season-of-Docs-2023-Case-Study)
* Be open to shifting project scope or deliverables as you learn things during the project [p5js](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CUdWiUtPJ66seFq_X_nwFUcUnow2eH8Sl2am_HFnm0E/edit)
* Engage the community to vote on which projects would be most valuable to pursue [AsyncAPI](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/961) [Flux](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z5JL5lx2s-I_KWLfXLHGVO7UlfSd0qwF4jpQ3-OtoSg/edit#heading=h.6r1pm5b15g4b)
* Plan project goals so that any progress is worthwhile, not just completely finished projects (MicroPython; 3e780f)
* If you have multiple similar tasks, choose one as a test run and use it to estimate the amount of work for the full project. [p5js](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CUdWiUtPJ66seFq_X_nwFUcUnow2eH8Sl2am_HFnm0E/edit)

## Recruiting & Hiring
* Choose a technical writer with background/skills not represented among core maintainers [Sigstore](https://github.com/sigstore/docs/wiki/Sigstore-Google-Season-of-Docs-2023-Case-Study)
* Have a scalable hiring process in place before you start recruiting for the role [Compiler Research](https://compiler-research.org/assets/docs/gsod_casestudy_2023.pdf)
* Only hire as many Tech Writers as you have the capacity to mentor, onboard, and manage [AsyncAPI](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/961)
* Track applicants in a central tool (e.g. a spreadsheet). [Conda](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-dot-org/discussions/168)
* Consider including a situational question in your application, such as “How would you improve this existing documentation page?” [Compiler Research](https://compiler-research.org/assets/docs/gsod_casestudy_2023.pdf)
* Agree on required and preferred qualifications before recruiting, to avoid bias and share the load of reviewing candidates [Conda](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-dot-org/discussions/168)
* Have candidates submit structured applications that feed into a central tracker (e.g. Google Form to Spreadsheet) to minimize back and forth email burden [Conda](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-dot-org/discussions/168)
* Have at least two team members interview candidates [Digital Biomarker Discovery Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eJb7kUmn7jBnDrXE6rz2Egt_mhO8tqj0MQbrti9mofU/edit)
* Consider recruiting from existing contributors [p5js](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CUdWiUtPJ66seFq_X_nwFUcUnow2eH8Sl2am_HFnm0E/edit) [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/resources/publish/MicroPython_Season_of_Docs__2023_Case_Study.pdf)
* Be clear in your recruiting materials if the documentation work will require reading the project source code. [p5js](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CUdWiUtPJ66seFq_X_nwFUcUnow2eH8Sl2am_HFnm0E/edit)

## Tooling
* Although the [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework works for many projects, don't feel constrained to use it if you find it's not right for yours. [OpenQuake](https://docs.google.com/document/d/191xaDUmcoR2sx8VuYVB1mVwrFuD0br685cK0sdmPrb4/edit#heading=h.p1qoh7shayvf)
* Determine what style guide to use for the project [p5js](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CUdWiUtPJ66seFq_X_nwFUcUnow2eH8Sl2am_HFnm0E/edit)
